To ensure data privacy, we cannot provide the raw data collected by the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children study (HBSC) and the Dutch National School Survey on Substance Use (DNSSSU). HBSC is an international study carried out in collaboration with WHO/EURO. Two of our authors, Gonneke Stevens and Saskia van Dorsselaer, are principal investigators in the Netherlands. One of our authors, Karin Monshouwer, is the principal investigator of DNSSSU, the Dutch branch of the international ESPAD study. 

A complete and an incomplete slice of the dataset can be found in the folder data_input/HBSC_DNSSSU/MPALC/. The full dataset can be made available upon request.
